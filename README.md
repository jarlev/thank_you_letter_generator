<h1> Thank you letter generator - README </h1>
<h2> Version 1: June 8, 2016 </h2>

<p>This is a very simple application, designed to make writing thank you letters a bit less tedious.</p>
<br>
There are five types of models in this version: 
<ul>
	<li>user</li>
	<li>letter</li>
	<li>greeting</li>
	<li>body</li>
	<li>closing</li>
</ul>
<p>The form to create a letter will prompt a user to choose a greeting (either from the preset list, or one that they create), body, and closing. They will also input a 'to_name' so the app knows who to address the letter to, and specify a letter type, to make sorting easier (sorting will be available in future releases.)</p>
<br>
<p>The project comes with a seed file, with several greeting, body, and closing examples to choose from. Just use rake db:seed if you'd like to include the examples on the 'new_letter' page.</p>
<br>
<p>I created this app as part of a goal of mine to create some simple, yet useful programs that I could add to my portfolio. My hope is that although the site is not super complicated, it can still be used to save people time and make routines more efficient. I hope you enjoy it!</p>
